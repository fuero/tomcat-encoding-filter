## Purpose

Shibboleth SP provides its attributes to Apache in UTF-8.
Sadly, if they are passed on to Tomcat, it [defaults to
ISO 8859-1][bytechunk] and doesn't enumerate passed AJP attributes 
(when using `ShibUseEnvironment On`)

[AJP 1.3][ajp13] [doesn't][ajp13a] specify which encoding its strings should be in, so it relies
on HTTP. The [RFC][rfc7230] covering this isn't conclusive:

> Historically, HTTP has allowed field content with text in the
> ISO-8859-1 charset [ISO-8859-1], supporting other charsets only
> through use of [RFC2047] encoding.  In practice, most HTTP header
> field values use only a subset of the US-ASCII charset [USASCII].
> Newly defined header fields SHOULD limit their field values to
> US-ASCII octets.  A recipient SHOULD treat other octets in field
> content (obs-text) as opaque data.

Furthermore, it fixes getAttributeNames(), which doesn't yield *anything*
when using AJP.

## Usage

Add this to your `web.xml`

    <filter>
      <filter-name>my-encoding-filter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>at.jku.filters.SetCharacterEncodingFilter</filter-class>
      <init-param>
        <param-name>encoding</param-name>
        <param-value>UTF-8</param-value>
      </init-param>
    </filter>
     
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>my-encoding-filter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
